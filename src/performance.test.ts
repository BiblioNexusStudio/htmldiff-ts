        `<h1 dir="ltr">BIBLE*, Canon of the</h1><p dir="ltr">Those books in the Jewish and Christian Bible considered to be Scripture and therefore authoritative in matters of faith and doctrine. The term translates both a Greek and a Hebrew word that mean “a rule,” or “measuring rod.” It is a list to which other books are compared and by which they are measured. After the fourth century AD, the Christian church found itself with only 66 books that constituted its Scripture; 27 of these were the NT and 39 were the OT. Just as Plato, Aristotle, and Homer form a canon of Greek literature, so the NT books became the canon of Christian literature. The criteria for selecting the books in the Jewish canon (the OT) are not known but clearly had to do with their worth in the ongoing life and religion of the worshiping nation. The criteria of the selection of NT books revolved around their “apostolicity,” according to early church writers. Like those of the OT, these books were collected and preserved by local churches in the continuing process of their worship and need for authoritative guidance for Christian living. The formation of the canon was a process, rather than an event, that took several hundred years to reach finality in all parts of the Roman Empire. Local canons were the basis for comparison, and out of them eventually emerged the general canon that exists in Christendom today, although some of the Eastern churches have a NT that is slightly smaller than that accepted in the West. Judaism, as well as Christianity as a whole, believes that the Spirit of God was operative in some providential way in the production and preservation of his Word. The term "canon" refers to the list of books that are considered to be Scripture and authoritative in matters of faith and doctrine in the Jewish and Christian Bible. This list is used as a standard for comparison and measurement for other books. After the fourth century AD, the Christian church recognized 66 books as its Scripture, with 27 being in the New Testament and 39 in the Old Testament. Just as Plato, Aristotle, and Homer are considered to be part of the canon of Greek literature, the books of the New Testament became the canon of Christian literature. The criteria for selecting the books in the Jewish canon (the Old Testament) are not known, but they were likely chosen for their significance in the ongoing life and religion of the worshiping nation. The criteria for selecting the books in the New Testament were based on their "apostolicity," according to early church writers. These books were collected and preserved by local churches as they continued to worship and seek authoritative guidance for Christian living. The formation of the canon was a gradual process that took several hundred years to reach completion throughout the Roman Empire. Local canons were used as a basis for comparison, and eventually, the general canon that is accepted in Christendom today emerged, although some Eastern churches have a slightly smaller New Testament. Both Judaism and Christianity believe that the Spirit of God played a role in the production and preservation of the Scriptures.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Canon of the Old Testament</h2><p dir="ltr">The Old Testament is a name that does not appear in Jewish literature. Jews prefer to call their collection of Scriptures the TANAK—an acronym formed from the first letters of <em>Torah</em> (Law), <em>Nevi’im</em> (Prophets), and <em>Kethubim</em> (Writings). In <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043024044" data-endverse="1043024044" style="color: green">Luke 24:44</span> (niv), these are called the “Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms” (the first book of the Writings in the Hebrew Bible). Christians called their collection of writings the New Testament, or covenant, the latter term being a designation earlier used of the agreement God made with Abraham and the patriarchs, which was repeated by Christ to his apostles (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1041026028" data-endverse="1041026028" style="color: green">Mt 26:28</span>). Christians in the first century considered their new covenant from Christ (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047011025" data-endverse="1047011025" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Cor 11:25</span>) to be a continuation of the one made earlier with the patriarchs (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1050002012" data-endverse="1050002012" style="color: green">Eph 2:12</span>), spoken of by the prophets (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1024031031" data-endverse="1024031034" style="color: green">Jer 31:31-34</span>), and which was therefore called a former covenant (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1059008007" data-endverse="1059008013" style="color: green">Heb 8:7-13</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1059009001" data-endverse="1059009001" style="color: green">9:1, 15-22</span>) or in later centuries the OT. The terms “Old” and “New” do not appear in the apostolic fathers of the first and second century or in the apologists of the early- to mid-second century, but they do appear in the latter half of the second century in Justin Martyr (<em>Dialogues</em> 11:2), Irenaeus (<em>Against Heresies</em> 4.9.1), and Clement of Alexandria (<em>Stromata</em> 1:5). In these authors the expression referred more to the covenant itself than to the books containing it, though the transfer was eventually made. The term “canon” was not used in the OT or NT to refer to the Jewish Scriptures. The idea of limitation inherent in the word was not appropriate to the nature of religious authority in Jewish religion during the thousand years when the OT books were being written. Only the Torah was conceived as incapable of being added to or taken from (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1005004002" data-endverse="1005004002" style="color: green">Dt 4:2</span>). Jewish religion existed for a millennium, from Moses to Malachi, without a closed canon, i.e., an exclusive list of authoritative books. Never in their history did the people of the OT have the entire 39 books of the OT. When their canon was closed is not known. Although some questions were being asked about religious authority by rabbis at Jamnia 20 years after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70, we have our first list of 39 books produced by Melito of Sardis around AD 170. That list included no books written after the time of Malachi, unless one is disposed to date Daniel to the second century. The Prophets and the Writings were always considered secondary to the Law. Their composition and collection was a process rather than an event in the life of the people of Israel and functioned largely as a record of the nation’s response to the Law, which was so sacred that it was kept (according to rabbinical tradition: Babylonian Talmud, <em>Baba Bathra</em> 14a; cf. also <em>Cairo Damascus Document</em> 5.2) in the ark of the covenant that stood in the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle. In <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1005031026" data-endverse="1005031026" style="color: green">Deuteronomy 31:26</span>, however, the Levites were commanded by Moses merely to put the Book of the Law beside the ark. Nevertheless, its very presence in the Holy of Holies establishes its uniqueness in relation to other OT books.</p><p dir="ltr">The 39 books of the modern OT were originally divided into only 24, according to the uniform testimony of early Hebrew tradition. The Talmud, rabbinic literature, and probably 4&nbsp;Esdras testify to this arrangement that included five books of the Law, eight Prophets, and eleven Writings (Greek—Hagiographa). Modern Hebrew Bibles reflect this tripartite arrangement that was used in the first three printed editions (Soncino, 1488; Naples, 1491–1493; Brescia, 1492–1494). The Law contained the Pentateuch in our familiar order, Genesis to Deuteronomy. The eight Prophets were Joshua, Judges, Samuel (1 and 2), Kings (1 and 2), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Minor Prophets (all 12), which were considered as one book and arranged in the same order as our English Bibles. The eleven books of Writings contained three of poetry (Ps, Prv, Jb), the Five Scrolls (Sg, Ru, Lam, Eccl, Est), which were read at the important feasts and arranged in the chronological order of their observance, and three of narrative or historical (Dn, Ezr-Neh, 1 and 2&nbsp;Chr).</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from authentic Jewish tradition, efforts were made to divide the books into 21, combining Ruth with Judges, and Lamentations with Jeremiah. Josephus was the first to do so, in the first century AD, but he was influenced by the Greek OT, the Septuagint. Origen observed in the early third century that this arrangement also corresponded to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, as did Athanasius in the fourth, and others, including Jerome. It was dubiously concluded that the number of books in the Hebrew Bible had been divinely ordained to agree with the number of letters of the Hebrew alphabet! Church fathers added their support to this coincidence, which became providence to them. All such efforts, however, are of Greek origin and have no support in Hebrew tradition. This arrangement was believed to be divinely ordained by some, but it is of Greek origin and has no support in Hebrew tradition.</p><p dir="ltr">The oldest extant manuscripts of the complete OT in Hebrew are the Masoretic Texts, which are no earlier than the eighth century AD. Only manuscripts of individual books have been found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Masoretic scribes apparently laid down no rules about arrangement of books because there is no uniform order of the Latter Prophets or the Writings in early Hebrew manuscripts. Nor is the situation any different in ancient Greek translations of the Hebrew. Great diversity exists in the order of books in all three of our oldest manuscripts—Codex Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, and Sinaiticus. All the early Christian authors who profess to give the order and contents of the Hebrew Bible but who do not reflect the Hebrew tripartite division are clearly dependent on the Alexandrian order reflected in these Greek editions, rather than on the Hebrew Bible. Modern Protestant Bibles follow the order of the Latin Vulgate and the content of the Hebrew. Both the Vulgate and the Septuagint (Greek translation) contained the Apocrypha, which was never accepted by the Jews. The Roman Catholic Church includes the Apocrypha in its English translations because of the influence of the Vulgate on Catholic tradition. It is considered deuterocanonical.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though no uniformity of order was maintained, the Alexandrian order, reflected in the Greek manuscripts, generally arranged books according to their subject matter—narrative, history, poetry, and prophecy, with the apocryphal books appropriately interspersed into these categories. The Hebrew division was totally ignored.</p><p dir="ltr">Early Hebrew Bibles divided the text into small paragraphs and larger sections somewhat akin to our paragraphs. These were indicated by spaces left between them—three letters between the small sections and nine letters between the larger ones. The number of sections is not the same in all manuscripts. Jesus probably referred to such sections in his comment concerning the “passage about the bush” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1042012026" data-endverse="1042012026" style="color: green">Mk 12:26</span>). Later, liturgical needs led to further divisions of the text for the complete reading of the Law in Babylonian synagogues in one year (54 sections) and in Palestinian synagogues in three years (154 sections). These are reflected in the lectionary cycles marked in some early Hebrew Bibles. These divisions were made to accommodate the reading of the Law in synagogues, with 54 sections being read in one year in Babylonian synagogues and 154 sections being read in three years in Palestinian synagogues.</p><p dir="ltr">The division of the text into modern chapters, done in the 13th century (c. 1228) for the Latin Vulgate by Stephen Langton, was applied to the Hebrew Bible in 1518 (Bomberg Edition), but the numbers were not given to the chapters until 1571 in the text of Montanus, a Hebrew Bible with Latin interlinear translation. The verses were introduced in Bomberg’s Great Bible of 1547–48 in which every fifth verse was designated by a Hebrew numeral 1, 5, 10, and so on. Verses were inserted into the Latin Vulgate in 1555 in the small octavo edition of Stephanus.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Canon of the New Testament</h2><p dir="ltr">The New Testament was written within the period of fifty years, several centuries after the completion of the Old Testament. Both halves of that statement would be questioned by modern critics, who would extend the time span for completion of both Testaments. The writer of this survey is confident of its truthfulness to historic fact, however, and the approach taken to canonization of both Old Testament and New Testament is based solidly upon that twofold premise.</p><p dir="ltr">In a sense, we possess far higher certification of the Old Testament canon than of the New Testament canon. We refer to the fact of our Lord’s own imprimatur by way of his use of the Hebrew Scriptures as the authoritative Word of God. Yet there is a sense in which Jesus Christ did establish the New Testament content or canon as well, by way of anticipation. It was he who promised, “The Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you” and “he will guide you into all truth” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044014026" data-endverse="1044014026" style="color: green">Jn 14:26</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044016013" data-endverse="1044016013" style="color: green">16:13</span>, niv).</p><p dir="ltr">From this we can derive, in turn, the basic principle of canonicity for the NT. It is identical to that of the OT, since it narrows down to a matter of divine inspiration. Whether we think of the prophets of OT times or the apostles and their God-given associates of the New, the recognition at the very time of their writing that they were authentic spokesmen for God is what determines the intrinsic canonicity of their writing. It is altogether God’s Word only if it is God-breathed. We can be assured that the books under question were received by the church of the apostolic age precisely when they had been certified by an apostle as being thus inspired. The apparent variation, relative to geographic area, in acknowledgment of some of the NT epistles may well reflect the simple fact that this attestation was by its very nature localized at first. Conversely, that all 27 books of the now universally received NT were ultimately agreed upon is evidence that proper attestation was indeed confirmed after rigorous investigation.</p><p dir="ltr">Tertullian, an outstanding Christian writer in the first two decades of the third century, was one of the first to refer to the Christian Scriptures as the “New Testament.” That title had appeared earlier (c. 190) in a composition against Montanism, the author of which is unknown. This is significant. Its use placed the New Testament Scripture on a level of inspiration and authority with the Old Testament.</p><p dir="ltr">From available information, the gradual process that led to full and formal public recognition of a fixed canon of the 27 books comprising the NT takes us down into the fourth century of our era. This does not necessarily mean that these Scriptures were lacking recognition in their entirety before that time, but that a need for officially defining the canon was not pressing until then. It is important to note that the term "canon" refers to the collection of books that are considered authoritative and inspired by God. This process of defining the canon was not urgent until the fourth century, but it does not mean that these books were not recognized as important before then.</p><p dir="ltr">Though a much shorter period of time was involved in the writing of the New Testament (NT) than the Old Testament (OT), the geographic range of its origin is far wider. This circumstance alone is sufficient to account for a lack of spontaneous or simultaneous recognition of the precise extent of the NT canon. Because of the geographic isolation of the various recipients of portions of the NT, there was bound to be some lag and uncertainty from one region to another in the acknowledgment of some of the books. This means that due to the wide range of locations where the NT was written, there may have been delays and uncertainty in recognizing which books were part of the NT canon.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to understand what happened during the process of canonization of the NT books, we must review the available information. This will allow us to examine <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> our early Christian ancestors chose the 27 books in our NT.</p><p dir="ltr">The historic process was a gradual and continuous one, but it will help us understand it if we subdivide the nearly three and a half centuries involved into shorter periods of time. Some speak of three major stages toward canonization. This implies, without justification, that there are readily discernible steps along the way. Others simply present a long list of the names of persons and documents involved. Such a list makes it difficult to sense any motion at all. A somewhat arbitrary breakdown into five periods will be made here, with the reminder that the spreading of the knowledge of sacred literature and the deepening consensus as to its authenticity as inspired Scripture continued uninterruptedly. The periods are:</p><p dir="ltr">1. The time period of the first century</p><p dir="ltr">2. First Half of Second Century</p><p dir="ltr">3. Second Half of Second Century</p><p dir="ltr">4. Third Century</p><p dir="ltr">5. Fourth Century</p><p dir="ltr">Again, without meaning to imply that these are clear-cut stages, it will be helpful to notice the major trends observable in each of the periods just identified. In the first period, of course, the various books were written, but they also began to be copied and disseminated among the churches. In the second, as they became more widely known and cherished for their contents, they began to be cited as authoritative. By the end of the third period, they held a recognized place alongside the OT as “Scripture,” and they began to be both translated into regional languages and made the subject of commentaries. During the third century AD, our fourth period, the collecting of books into a whole “New Testament” was underway, together with a sifting process that was separating them from other Christian literature. The final, or fifth, period finds the church fathers of the fourth century stating that conclusions regarding the canon have been reached that indicate acceptance by the whole church. Thus, in the most strict and formal sense of the word, the canon had become fixed. It remains to list in greater detail the forces and individuals that produced the written sources witnessing to this remarkable process through which, by God’s providence, we have inherited our NT.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period One: First Century</h3><p dir="ltr">The principle determining recognition of the authority of the canonical NT writings was established within the content of those writings themselves. There are repeated exhortations for public reading of the apostolic communications. At the close of his First Letter to the Thessalonians, possibly the first book of the NT to be written, Paul says, “I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1053005027" data-endverse="1053005027" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Thes 5:27</span>, nlt). Earlier in the same letter Paul commends their ready acceptance of his spoken word as “the word of God” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1053002013" data-endverse="1053002013" style="color: green">2:13</span>), and in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047014037" data-endverse="1047014037" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:37</span> he speaks similarly of his “writings,” insisting that his message be recognized as a commandment from the Lord himself. (See also <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1052004016" data-endverse="1052004016" style="color: green">Col 4:16</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1067001003" data-endverse="1067001003" style="color: green">Rv 1:3</span>.) In <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1062003015" data-endverse="1062003016" style="color: green">2&nbsp;Peter 3:15-16</span> Paul’s letters are included with “the other Scriptures.” Since Peter’s is a general letter, widespread knowledge of Paul’s letters is thereby implied. Highly indicative also is Paul’s usage in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1055005018" data-endverse="1055005018" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:18</span>. He follows up the formula “the Scriptures say” by a combined quotation about not muzzling an ox (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1005025004" data-endverse="1005025004" style="color: green">Dt 25:4</span>) and “the worker deserves his wages” (cf. <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043010007" data-endverse="1043010007" style="color: green">Lk 10:7</span>). Thus, an equivalence is implied between OT Scripture and a NT Gospel.</p><p dir="ltr">In AD 95, Clement of Rome wrote to the Christians in Corinth using a free rendering of material from Matthew and Luke. He seems to be strongly influenced by Hebrews and is obviously familiar with Romans and Corinthians. There are also reflections of Ephesians, 1&nbsp;Timothy, Titus, and 1&nbsp;Peter. Clement of Rome wrote to the Christians in Corinth in the year 95 AD, using a free rendering of material from Matthew and Luke. He seems to be strongly influenced by Hebrews and is obviously familiar with Romans and Corinthians. There are also reflections of Ephesians, 1&nbsp;Timothy, Titus, and 1&nbsp;Peter.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period Two: First Half of Second Century</h3><p dir="ltr">One of the earliest New Testament manuscripts yet discovered, a fragment of John from Egypt known as the John Rylands papyrus, demonstrates how the writings of the apostle John were highly respected and copied by about AD 125, within 30 to 35 years of his death. There is evidence that within 30 years of the apostle’s death all the Gospels and Pauline letters were known and used in all those centers from which any evidence has come down to us. It is true that some of the smaller letters were being questioned as to their authority in some areas for perhaps another 50 years, but this was due only to uncertainty about their authorship in those particular locations. This demonstrates that acceptance was not being imposed by the actions of councils but was rather happening spontaneously through a normal response on the part of those who had learned the facts about authorship. In those places where the churches were uncertain about the authorship or apostolic approval of certain books, acceptance was slower.</p><p dir="ltr">The first three outstanding church fathers, Clement, Polycarp, and Ignatius, used the bulk of the material of the NT in a revealingly casual manner—authenticated Scriptures were being accepted as authoritative without argument. In the writings of these men only Mark (which closely parallels the material of Matthew), 2&nbsp;Peter, 2 and 3&nbsp;John, and Jude are not clearly attested. The first three influential leaders of the early Christian church, Clement, Polycarp, and Ignatius, referenced the majority of the New Testament material in a casual manner, without needing to argue for its authority. Only the books of Mark, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude are not clearly supported in their writings.</p><p dir="ltr">The Epistles of Ignatius (c. AD 115) have correspondences in several places with the Gospels and seem to incorporate language from a number of the Pauline letters. The Didache (or Teaching of the Twelve), perhaps even earlier, makes references to a written Gospel. Most important is the fact that Clement, Barnabas, and Ignatius all draw a clear distinction between their own and the inspired, authoritative apostolic writings. It is noteworthy to mention that the Epistles of Ignatius, written around 115 AD, have similarities with the Gospels and contain language from various Pauline letters. The Didache, which may have been written even earlier, also references a written Gospel. Additionally, Clement, Barnabas, and Ignatius all make a clear distinction between their own writings and the inspired, authoritative apostolic writings.</p><p dir="ltr">It is in the Epistle of Barnabas (c. AD 130) that we first find the formula “it is written” (4:14) used in reference to a New Testament book (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1041022014" data-endverse="1041022014" style="color: green">Mt 22:14</span>). But even before this, Polycarp, who had personal acquaintance with eyewitnesses of our Lord’s ministry, used a combined Old Testament and New Testament quotation. Citing Paul’s admonition in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1050004026" data-endverse="1050004026" style="color: green">Ephesians 4:26</span>, where the apostle quotes <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1019004004" data-endverse="1019004004" style="color: green">Psalm 4:4</span> and makes an addition, Polycarp in his Epistle to the Philippians introduces the reference by “as it is said in these Scriptures” (12:4). Then Papias, bishop of Hierapolis (c. 130–140), in a work preserved for us by Eusebius, mentions by name the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and his use of them as the basis of exposition indicates his acceptance of them as canonical. Also around AD 140, the recently discovered Gospel of Truth (a Gnostic-oriented work probably authored by Valentinius) makes an important contribution. Its use of canonical New Testament sources, treating them as authoritative, is comprehensive enough to warrant the conclusion that in Rome at this period there was a New Testament compilation in existence corresponding very closely to our own. Citations are made from the Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul, Hebrews, and the book of Revelation.</p><p dir="ltr">The heretic Marcion, by defining a limited canon of his own (c. 140), in effect hastened the day when the orthodox believers needed to declare themselves on this issue. Rejecting the entire Old Testament, Marcion settled for Luke’s Gospel (eliminating chapters <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043001001" data-endverse="1043001080" style="color: green">1</span> and <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043002001" data-endverse="1043002052" style="color: green">2</span> as too Jewish) and Paul’s letters (except for the pastoral ones). Interestingly, especially in the light of <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1052004016" data-endverse="1052004016" style="color: green">Colossians 4:16</span>, he substitutes the name “Laodiceans” for Ephesians. This means that Marcion rejected the Jewish scriptures and only accepted certain parts of the New Testament, specifically Luke's Gospel and some of Paul's letters. He also changed the name of the letter to the Ephesians to the Laodiceans, which is mentioned in Colossians 4:16.</p><p dir="ltr">Near the end of this period, Justin Martyr, in describing the worship services of the early church, puts the apostolic writings on a par with those of the Old Testament prophets. He states that the voice which spoke through the apostles of Christ in the New Testament was the same as that which spoke through the prophets—the voice of God—and the same voice that Abraham heard, responding in faith and obedience. Justin was also free in his use of “it is written” with quotations from New Testament Scriptures.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period Three: Second Half of Second Century</h3><p dir="ltr">Irenaeus had the privilege of beginning his Christian training under Polycarp, a disciple of apostles. Then, as a presbyter in Lyons, he had association with Bishop Pothinus, whose own background also included contact with first-generation Christians. Irenaeus quotes from almost all of the New Testament on the basis of its authority and asserts that the apostles were given power from on high. They were, he says, “fully informed concerning all things, and had a perfect knowledge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. having indeed all in equal measure and each one singly the Gospel of God” (<em>Against Heresies</em> 3.3). Irenaeus gives reasons why there should be four Gospels. “The word,” he says, “gave us the Gospel in a fourfold shape, but held together by one Spirit.” In addition to the Gospels, he also makes reference to Acts, all of Paul's letters except Philemon, 1&nbsp;Peter, 1&nbsp;John, and the book of Revelation.</p><p dir="ltr">Tatian, pupil of Justin Martyr, made a harmony of the four Gospels, the <em>Diatessaron,</em> attesting to the equal status they had in the church by AD 170. Other “gospels” had come into existence by then, but he recognized only the four. Also dating from about 170 was the <em>Muratorian Canon.</em> An eighth-century copy of this document was discovered and published in 1740 by librarian L. A. Muratori. The manuscript is mutilated at both ends, but the remaining text makes it evident that Matthew and Mark were included in the now missing part. The fragment begins with Luke and John, cites Acts, 13&nbsp;Pauline letters, 1 and 2&nbsp;John, Jude, and Revelation. There follows a statement, “We accept only the Apocalypse of John and Peter, although some of us do not want it [Apocalypse of Peter is 2&nbsp;Peter?] to be read in the Church.” The list goes on to reject by name various heretical leaders and their writings.</p><p dir="ltr">Translated versions existed by this period. In the form of Syriac and Old Latin translations we secure, by AD 170, adequate witness from the extreme eastern and western branches of the church, as we might well expect from the other evidence in hand. The New Testament collection of books is represented with no additions and the omission of only one book, 2&nbsp;Peter.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period Four: Third Century</h3><p dir="ltr">The remarkable Christian name of the third century is that of Origen (AD 185– 254). A prolific scholar and interpreter, he conducted critical studies of the NT text (alongside his work on the <em>Hexapla</em>) and wrote commentaries and homilies on most of the books of the NT, emphasizing their divine inspiration.</p><p dir="ltr">Dionysius of Alexandria, student of Origen, indicates that while the Western church accepted the book of Revelation from the beginning, its position in the East was not always consistent. In the case of the Letter to the Hebrews, the situation was reversed. It proved to be less secure in the West than in the East. When it comes to other disputed books (note, incidently, that all in that category have the last position in our current Bibles—Hebrews to Revelation), among the so-called “Catholic Epistles” Dionysius supports James and 2 and 3&nbsp;John but not 2&nbsp;Peter or Jude. In other words, even at the end of the third century there was still uncertainty about certain books, just as there was at the beginning. Period Five: Fourth Century Early in this period, the picture begins to clarify. Eusebius (AD 270–340, bishop of Caesarea before 315), the great church historian, sets forth his estimate of the canon in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (3.3–25). Herein he makes a straightforward statement on the status of the canon in the early part of the fourth century: (1)&nbsp;Universally agreed upon as canonical were the four Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul (including Hebrews, with question about his authorship), 1&nbsp;Peter, 1&nbsp;John, and Revelation. (2)&nbsp;Admitted by a majority, including Eusebius himself, but disputed by some were James, 2&nbsp;Peter (the most strongly contested), 2 and 3&nbsp;John, and Jude. (3)&nbsp;The Acts of Paul, the Didache, and Shepherd of Hermas were classified “spurious,” and still other writings were listed as “heretical and absurd.” It is in the latter half of the fourth century, however, that the New Testament canon finds full and final declaration. In his <em>Festal Letter</em> for Easter, 367, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria included information designed to eliminate once and for all the use of certain apocryphal books. This letter, with its admonition, “Let no one add to these; let nothing be taken away,” gives us the earliest extant document that specifies our 27 books without qualification. At the close of the century, the Council of Carthage (AD 397) decreed that “aside from the canonical Scriptures nothing is to be read in church under the Name of Divine Scriptures.” This, too, lists the 27 books of the New Testament. The sudden advance of Christianity under Emperor Constantine (Edict of Milan, 313) had a great deal to do with the reception of all the New Testament books in the East. When he assigned Eusebius the task of preparing “fifty copies of the Divine Scriptures,” the historian, fully aware of which were the sacred books for which many believers had been willing to lay down their very lives, in effect established the standard that gave recognition to all of the once-doubtful books. In the West, of course, Jerome and Augustine were the leaders who exercised a determinitive influence. Publication of the 27 books in the Vulgate version virtually settled the matter. Principles and Factors That Determine the Canon By its very nature, Holy Scripture, whether Old Testament or New Testament, is a production given of God, not the work of human creation. The key to canonicity is divine inspiration. Therefore, the method of determination is not one of selection from a number of possible candidates (there are no other candidates, in actuality) but one of reception of authentic material and its consequent recognition by an ever-widening circle as the facts of its origin become known. In a sense, the movement of Montanus, which was declared heretical by the church of his day (mid-second century), was an impetus toward the recognition of a closed canon of the written Word of God. He taught that the prophetic gift was permanently granted to the church and that he himself was a prophet. The pressure to deal with Montanism, therefore, intensified the search for a basic authority, and apostolic authorship or approval became recognized as the only sure standard for identifying God’s revelation. Even within the Scripture record, first-century prophets were subordinate and subject to apostolic authority (see, for example, <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047014029" data-endverse="1047014030" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Cor 14:29-30</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1050004011" data-endverse="1050004011" style="color: green">Eph 4:11</span>). When all things were being reexamined in the Protestant Reformation, some of the Reformers sought means of reassuring themselves and their followers about the canon of Scripture. This was in some ways an unfortunate aspect of Reformation thinking, because once God in his providence had determined for his people the fixed content of Scripture, that became a fact of history and was not a repeatable process. Nevertheless, Luther established a theological test for the books of the Bible (and questioned some of them)—“Do they teach Christ?” Equally subjective, it would seem, was Calvin’s insistence that the Spirit of God bears witness to each individual Christian in any age of church history as to what is his Word and what is not. Actually, even for the initial acceptance of the written Word, it is neither safe nor sound (as far as Scripture or history teaches us) to say that recognition and reception was an intuitive matter. It was rather a matter of simple obedience to the known commands of Christ and his apostles. As we saw at the outset, our Lord promised (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044014026" data-endverse="1044014026" style="color: green">Jn 14:26</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044016013" data-endverse="1044016013" style="color: green">16:13</span>) to communicate all things necessary through his agents. The apostles were conscious of this responsibility and agency as they wrote. Paul’s explanation in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047002013" data-endverse="1047002013" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</span> is apropos: “In telling you about these gifts we have even used the very words given to us by the Holy Spirit, not words that we as men might choose. So we use the Holy Spirit’s words to explain the Holy Spirit’s facts” (tlb). Hence, the early church, with closer ties and greater information than is available to us today, examined the testimony of the ancients. They were able to discern which were the authentic and authoritative books by their apostolic origin. Mark’s association with Peter, and Luke’s with Paul, gave them such apostolic approval, and epistles like Hebrews and Jude were also tied in with the apostolic message and ministry. Incontrovertible consistency of doctrine in all the books, including the sometime contested ones, was perhaps a subordinate test. But historically the procedure was essentially one of acceptance and approval of those books that were vouched for by knowledgeable church leaders. Full acceptance by the original recipients followed by a continued acknowledgment and use is an essential factor in the development of the canon. The church’s concept of canon, derived first of all from the reverence given the OT Scriptures, rested in the conviction that the apostles were uniquely authorized to speak in the name of the one who possessed all authority—the Lord Jesus Christ. The development from there is logical and straightforward. Those who heard Jesus in person were immediately subject to his authority. He personally authenticated his words to the believers. These same believers knew that Jesus authorized his apostles to speak in his name, both during and (more significantly) after his earthly ministry. Apostolic speaking on behalf of Christ was recognized in the church, whether in personal utterance or in written form. Both the spoken word of an apostle and the letter of an apostle constituted the word of Christ. The generation that followed that of the apostles themselves received the witness of those who knew that the apostles had the right to speak and write in the name of Christ. Consequently, the second and third generation of Christians looked back to apostolic words (writings) as the very words of Christ. This is what is really meant by canonization—recognition of the divinely authenticated Word. Hence, the believers (the church) did not establish the canon but simply bore witness to its extent by recognizing the authority of the word of Christ.</p>`,
        `<h1 dir="ltr">BIBLE*, Canon of the</h1><p dir="ltr">Those books in the Jewish and Christian Bible considered to be Scripture and therefore authoritative in matters of faith and doctrine. The term translates both a Greek and a Hebrew word that mean “a rule,” or “measuring rod.” Added a sentence here. It is a list to which other books are compared and by which they are measured. After the fourth century AD, the Christian church found itself with only 66 books that constituted its Scripture. The criteria for selecting the books in the Jewish canon (the OT) are not known but clearly had to do with their worth in the ongoing life and religion of the worshiping nation. The criteria of the selection of NT books revolved around their “apostolicity,” according to early church writers. Like those of the OT, these books were collected and preserved by local churches in the continuing process of their worship and need for authoritative guidance for Christian living. The formation of the canon was a process, rather than an event, that took several hundred years to reach finality in all parts of the Roman Empire. Local canons were the basis for comparison, and soon emerged a general canon that exists in Christendom today, although some of the Eastern churches have a NT that is slightly smaller than that accepted in the West. <strong>Judaism</strong>, as well as <strong>Christianity</strong> as a whole, believes that the Spirit of God was operative in some providential way in the production and preservation of his Word. The term "canon" refers to the list of books that are considered to be Scripture and authoritative in matters of faith and doctrine in the Jewish and Christian Bible. This list is used as a standard for comparison and measurement for other books. After the fourth century AD, the Christian church recognized 66 books as its Scripture, with 27 being in the New Testament and 39 in the Old Testament. Just as Plato, Aristotle, and Homer are considered to be part of the canon of Greek literature, the books of the New Testament became the canon of Christian literature. The criteria for selecting the books in the Jewish canon (the Old Testament) are not known, but they were likely chosen for their significance in the ongoing life and religion of the worshiping nation. The criteria for selecting the books in the New Testament were based on their "apostolicity," according to early church writers. These books were collected and preserved by local churches as they continued to worship and seek authoritative guidance for Christian living. The formation of the canon was a gradual process that took several hundred years to reach completion throughout the Roman Empire. Local canons were used as a basis for comparison, and eventually, the general canon that is accepted in Christendom today emerged, although some Eastern churches have a slightly smaller New Testament. Both Judaism and Christianity believe that the Spirit of God played a role in the production and preservation of the Scriptures.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Canon of the Old Testament</h2><p dir="ltr">The Old Testament is a name that does not appear in Jewish literature. Jews prefer to call their collection of Scriptures the TANAK—an acronym formed from the first letters of <em>Torah</em> (Law), <em>Nevi’im</em> (Prophets), and <em>Kethubim</em> (Writings). In <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043024044" data-endverse="1043024044" style="color: green">Luke 24:44</span> (niv), these are called the “Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms” (the first book of the Writings in the Hebrew Bible). Christians called their collection of writings the New Testament, or covenant, the latter term being a designation earlier used of the agreement God made with Abraham and the patriarchs, which was repeated by Christ to his apostles (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1041026028" data-endverse="1041026028" style="color: green">Mt 26:28</span>). Christians in the first century considered their new covenant from Christ (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047011025" data-endverse="1047011025" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Cor 11:25</span>) to be a continuation of the one made earlier with the patriarchs (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1050002012" data-endverse="1050002012" style="color: green">Eph 2:12</span>), spoken of by the prophets (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1024031031" data-endverse="1024031034" style="color: green">Jer 31:31-34</span>), and which was therefore called a former covenant (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1059008007" data-endverse="1059008013" style="color: green">Heb 8:7-13</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1059009001" data-endverse="1059009001" style="color: green">9:1, 15-22</span>) or in later centuries the OT. The terms “Old” and “New” do not appear in the apostolic fathers of the first and second century or in the apologists of the early- to mid-second century, but they do appear in the latter half of the second century in Justin Martyr (<em>Dialogues</em> 11:2), Irenaeus (<em>Against Heresies</em> 4.9.1), and Clement of Alexandria (<em>Stromata</em> 1:5). In these authors the expression referred more to the covenant itself than to the books containing it, though the transfer was eventually made. The term “canon” was not used in the OT or NT to refer to the Jewish Scriptures. The idea of limitation inherent in the word was not appropriate to the nature of religious authority in Jewish religion during the thousand years when the OT books were being written. Only the Torah was conceived as incapable of being added to or taken from (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1005004002" data-endverse="1005004002" style="color: green">Dt 4:2</span>). Jewish religion existed for a millennium, from Moses to Malachi, without a closed canon, i.e., an exclusive list of authoritative books. Never in their history did the people of the OT have the entire 39 books of the OT. When their canon was closed is not known. Although some questions were being asked about religious authority by rabbis at Jamnia 20 years after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70, we have our first list of 39 books produced by Melito of Sardis around AD 170. That list included no books written after the time of Malachi, unless one is disposed to date Daniel to the second century. The Prophets and the Writings were always considered secondary to the Law. Their composition and collection was a process rather than an event in the life of the people of Israel and functioned largely as a record of the nation’s response to the Law, which was so sacred that it was kept (according to rabbinical tradition: Babylonian Talmud, <em>Baba Bathra</em> 14a; cf. also <em>Cairo Damascus Document</em> 5.2) in the ark of the covenant that stood in the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle. In <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1005031026" data-endverse="1005031026" style="color: green">Deuteronomy 31:26</span>, however, the Levites were commanded by Moses merely to put the Book of the Law beside the ark. Nevertheless, its very presence in the Holy of Holies establishes its uniqueness in relation to other OT books.</p><p dir="ltr">The 39 books of the modern OT were originally divided into only 24, according to the uniform testimony of early Hebrew tradition. The Talmud, rabbinic literature, and probably 4&nbsp;Esdras testify to this arrangement that included five books of the Law, eight Prophets, and eleven Writings (Greek—Hagiographa). Modern Hebrew Bibles reflect this tripartite arrangement that was used in the first three printed editions (Soncino, 1488; Naples, 1491–1493; Brescia, 1492–1494). The Law contained the Pentateuch in our familiar order, Genesis to Deuteronomy. The eight Prophets were Joshua, Judges, Samuel (1 and 2), Kings (1 and 2), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Minor Prophets (all 12), which were considered as one book and arranged in the same order as our English Bibles. The eleven books of Writings contained three of poetry (Ps, Prv, Jb), the Five Scrolls (Sg, Ru, Lam, Eccl, Est), which were read at the important feasts and arranged in the chronological order of their observance, and three of narrative or historical (Dn, Ezr-Neh, 1 and 2&nbsp;Chr).</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from authentic Jewish tradition, efforts were made to divide the books into 21, combining Ruth with Judges, and Lamentations with Jeremiah. Josephus was the first to do so, in the first century AD, but he was influenced by the Greek OT, the Septuagint. Origen observed in the early third century that this arrangement also corresponded to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, as did Athanasius in the fourth, and others, including Jerome. It was dubiously concluded that the number of books in the Hebrew Bible had been divinely ordained to agree with the number of letters of the Hebrew alphabet! Church fathers added their support to this coincidence, which became providence to them. All such efforts, however, are of Greek origin and have no support in Hebrew tradition. This arrangement was believed to be divinely ordained by some, but it is of Greek origin and has no support in Hebrew tradition.</p><p dir="ltr">The oldest extant manuscripts of the complete OT in Hebrew are the Masoretic Texts, which are no earlier than the eighth century AD. Only manuscripts of individual books have been found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Masoretic scribes apparently laid down no rules about arrangement of books because there is no uniform order of the Latter Prophets or the Writings in early Hebrew manuscripts. Nor is the situation any different in ancient Greek translations of the Hebrew. Great diversity exists in the order of books in all three of our oldest manuscripts—Codex Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, and Sinaiticus. All the early Christian authors who profess to give the order and contents of the Hebrew Bible but who do not reflect the Hebrew tripartite division are clearly dependent on the Alexandrian order reflected in these Greek editions, rather than on the Hebrew Bible. Modern Protestant Bibles follow the order of the Latin Vulgate and the content of the Hebrew. Both the Vulgate and the Septuagint (Greek translation) contained the Apocrypha, which was never accepted by the Jews. The Roman Catholic Church includes the Apocrypha in its English translations because of the influence of the Vulgate on Catholic tradition. It is considered deuterocanonical.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though no uniformity of order was maintained, the Alexandrian order, reflected in the Greek manuscripts, generally arranged books according to their subject matter—narrative, history, poetry, and prophecy, with the apocryphal books appropriately interspersed into these categories. The Hebrew division was totally ignored.</p><p dir="ltr">Early Hebrew Bibles divided the text into small paragraphs and larger sections somewhat akin to our paragraphs. These were indicated by spaces left between them—three letters between the small sections and nine letters between the larger ones. The number of sections is not the same in all manuscripts. Jesus probably referred to such sections in his comment concerning the “passage about the bush” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1042012026" data-endverse="1042012026" style="color: green">Mk 12:26</span>). Later, liturgical needs led to further divisions of the text for the complete reading of the Law in Babylonian synagogues in one year (54 sections) and in Palestinian synagogues in three years (154 sections). These are reflected in the lectionary cycles marked in some early Hebrew Bibles. These divisions were made to accommodate the reading of the Law in synagogues, with 54 sections being read in one year in Babylonian synagogues and 154 sections being read in three years in Palestinian synagogues.</p><p dir="ltr">The division of the text into modern chapters, done in the 13th century (c. 1228) for the Latin Vulgate by Stephen Langton, was applied to the Hebrew Bible in 1518 (Bomberg Edition), but the numbers were not given to the chapters until 1571 in the text of Montanus, a Hebrew Bible with Latin interlinear translation. The verses were introduced in Bomberg’s Great Bible of 1547–48 in which every fifth verse was designated by a Hebrew numeral 1, 5, 10, and so on. Verses were inserted into the Latin Vulgate in 1555 in the small octavo edition of Stephanus.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Canon of the New Testament</h2><p dir="ltr">The New Testament was written within the period of fifty years, several centuries after the completion of the Old Testament. Both halves of that statement would be questioned by modern critics, who would extend the time span for completion of both Testaments. The writer of this survey is confident of its truthfulness to historic fact, however, and the approach taken to canonization of both Old Testament and New Testament is based solidly upon that twofold premise.</p><p dir="ltr">In a sense, we possess far higher certification of the Old Testament canon than of the New Testament canon. We refer to the fact of our Lord’s own imprimatur by way of his use of the Hebrew Scriptures as the authoritative Word of God. Yet there is a sense in which Jesus Christ did establish the New Testament content or canon as well, by way of anticipation. It was he who promised, “The Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you” and “he will guide you into all truth” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044014026" data-endverse="1044014026" style="color: green">Jn 14:26</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044016013" data-endverse="1044016013" style="color: green">16:13</span>, niv).</p><p dir="ltr">From this we can derive, in turn, the basic principle of canonicity for the NT. It is identical to that of the OT, since it narrows down to a matter of divine inspiration. Whether we think of the prophets of OT times or the apostles and their God-given associates of the New, the recognition at the very time of their writing that they were authentic spokesmen for God is what determines the intrinsic canonicity of their writing. It is altogether God’s Word only if it is God-breathed. We can be assured that the books under question were received by the church of the apostolic age precisely when they had been certified by an apostle as being thus inspired. The apparent variation, relative to geographic area, in acknowledgment of some of the NT epistles may well reflect the simple fact that this attestation was by its very nature localized at first. Conversely, that all 27 books of the now universally received NT were ultimately agreed upon is evidence that proper attestation was indeed confirmed after rigorous investigation.</p><p dir="ltr">Tertullian, an outstanding Christian writer in the first two decades of the third century, was one of the first to refer to the Christian Scriptures as the “New Testament.” That title had appeared earlier (c. 190) in a composition against Montanism, the author of which is unknown. This is significant. Its use placed the New Testament Scripture on a level of inspiration and authority with the Old Testament.</p><p dir="ltr">From available information, the gradual process that led to full and formal public recognition of a fixed canon of the 27 books comprising the NT takes us down into the fourth century of our era. This does not necessarily mean that these Scriptures were lacking recognition in their entirety before that time, but that a need for officially defining the canon was not pressing until then. It is important to note that the term "canon" refers to the collection of books that are considered authoritative and inspired by God. This process of defining the canon was not urgent until the fourth century, but it does not mean that these books were not recognized as important before then.</p><p dir="ltr">Though a much shorter period of time was involved in the writing of the New Testament (NT) than the Old Testament (OT), the geographic range of its origin is far wider. This circumstance alone is sufficient to account for a lack of spontaneous or simultaneous recognition of the precise extent of the NT canon. Because of the geographic isolation of the various recipients of portions of the NT, there was bound to be some lag and uncertainty from one region to another in the acknowledgment of some of the books. This means that due to the wide range of locations where the NT was written, there may have been delays and uncertainty in recognizing which books were part of the NT canon.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to understand what happened during the process of canonization of the NT books, we must review the available information. This will allow us to examine <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> our early Christian ancestors chose the 27 books in our NT.</p><p dir="ltr">The historic process was a gradual and continuous one, but it will help us understand it if we subdivide the nearly three and a half centuries involved into shorter periods of time. Some speak of three major stages toward canonization. This implies, without justification, that there are readily discernible steps along the way. Others simply present a long list of the names of persons and documents involved. Such a list makes it difficult to sense any motion at all. A somewhat arbitrary breakdown into five periods will be made here, with the reminder that the spreading of the knowledge of sacred literature and the deepening consensus as to its authenticity as inspired Scripture continued uninterruptedly. The periods are:</p><p dir="ltr">1. The time period of the first century</p><p dir="ltr">2. First Half of Second Century</p><p dir="ltr">3. Second Half of Second Century</p><p dir="ltr">4. Third Century</p><p dir="ltr">5. Fourth Century</p><p dir="ltr">Again, without meaning to imply that these are clear-cut stages, it will be helpful to notice the major trends observable in each of the periods just identified. In the first period, of course, the various books were written, but they also began to be copied and disseminated among the churches. In the second, as they became more widely known and cherished for their contents, they began to be cited as authoritative. By the end of the third period, they held a recognized place alongside the OT as “Scripture,” and they began to be both translated into regional languages and made the subject of commentaries. During the third century AD, our fourth period, the collecting of books into a whole “New Testament” was underway, together with a sifting process that was separating them from other Christian literature. The final, or fifth, period finds the church fathers of the fourth century stating that conclusions regarding the canon have been reached that indicate acceptance by the whole church. Thus, in the most strict and formal sense of the word, the canon had become fixed. It remains to list in greater detail the forces and individuals that produced the written sources witnessing to this remarkable process through which, by God’s providence, we have inherited our NT.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period One: First Century</h3><p dir="ltr">The principle determining recognition of the authority of the canonical NT writings was established within the content of those writings themselves. There are repeated exhortations for public reading of the apostolic communications. At the close of his First Letter to the Thessalonians, possibly the first book of the NT to be written, Paul says, “I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1053005027" data-endverse="1053005027" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Thes 5:27</span>, nlt). Earlier in the same letter Paul commends their ready acceptance of his spoken word as “the word of God” (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1053002013" data-endverse="1053002013" style="color: green">2:13</span>), and in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047014037" data-endverse="1047014037" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:37</span> he speaks similarly of his “writings,” insisting that his message be recognized as a commandment from the Lord himself. (See also <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1052004016" data-endverse="1052004016" style="color: green">Col 4:16</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1067001003" data-endverse="1067001003" style="color: green">Rv 1:3</span>.) In <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1062003015" data-endverse="1062003016" style="color: green">2&nbsp;Peter 3:15-16</span> Paul’s letters are included with “the other Scriptures.” Since Peter’s is a general letter, widespread knowledge of Paul’s letters is thereby implied. Highly indicative also is Paul’s usage in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1055005018" data-endverse="1055005018" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:18</span>.

Thus, an equivalence is implied between OT Scripture and a NT Gospel.</p><p dir="ltr">In AD 95, Clement of Rome wrote to the Christians in Corinth using a free rendering of material from Matthew and Luke. He seems to be strongly influenced by Hebrews and is obviously familiar with Romans and Corinthians. There are also reflections of Ephesians, 1&nbsp;Timothy, Titus, and 1&nbsp;Peter.

There is evidence that within 30 years of the apostle’s death all the Gospels and Pauline letters were known and used in all those centers from which any evidence has come down to us. It is true that some of the smaller letters were being questioned as to their authority in some areas for perhaps another 50 years, but this was due only to uncertainty about their authorship in those particular locations. This demonstrates that acceptance was not being imposed by the actions of councils but was rather happening spontaneously through a normal response on the part of those who had learned the facts about authorship. In those places where the churches were uncertain about the authorship or apostolic approval of certain books, acceptance was slower.</p><p dir="ltr">The first three outstanding church fathers, Clement, Polycarp, and Ignatius, used the bulk of the material of the NT in a revealingly casual manner—authenticated Scriptures were being accepted as authoritative without argument. In the writings of these men only Mark (which closely parallels the material of Matthew), 2&nbsp;Peter, 2 and 3&nbsp;John, and Jude are not clearly attested. The first three influential leaders of the early Christian church, Clement, Polycarp, and Ignatius, referenced the majority of the New Testament material in a casual manner, without needing to argue for its authority. Only the books of Mark, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude are not clearly supported in their writings.</p><p dir="ltr">The Epistles of Ignatius (c. AD 115) have correspondences in several places with the Gospels and seem to incorporate language from a number of the Pauline letters. The Didache (or Teaching of the Twelve), perhaps even earlier, makes references to a written Gospel. Most important is the fact that Clement, Barnabas, and Ignatius all draw a clear distinction between their own and the inspired, authoritative apostolic writings. It is noteworthy to mention that the Epistles of Ignatius, written around 115 AD, have similarities with the Gospels and contain language from various Pauline letters. The Didache, which may have been written even earlier, also references a written Gospel. Additionally, Clement, Barnabas, and Ignatius all make a clear distinction between their own writings and the inspired, authoritative apostolic writings.</p><p dir="ltr">It is in the Epistle of Barnabas (c. AD 130) that we first find the formula “it is written” (4:14) used in reference to a New Testament book (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1041022014" data-endverse="1041022014" style="color: green">Mt 22:14</span>). But even before this, Polycarp, who had personal acquaintance with eyewitnesses of our Lord’s ministry, used a combined Old Testament and New Testament quotation.

Then Papias, bishop of Hierapolis (c. 130–140), in a work preserved for us by Eusebius, mentions by name the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and his use of them as the basis of exposition indicates his acceptance of them as canonical. Also around AD 140, the recently discovered Gospel of Truth (a Gnostic-oriented work probably authored by Valentinius) makes an important contribution. Its use of canonical New Testament sources, treating them as authoritative, is comprehensive enough to warrant the conclusion that in Rome at this period there was a New Testament compilation in existence corresponding very closely to our own. Citations are made from the Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul, Hebrews, and the book of Revelation.</p><p dir="ltr">The heretic Marcion, by defining a limited canon of his own (c. 140), in effect hastened the day when the orthodox believers needed to declare themselves on this issue. Rejecting the entire Old Testament, Marcion settled for Luke’s Gospel (eliminating chapters <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043001001" data-endverse="1043001080" style="color: green">1</span> and <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1043002001" data-endverse="1043002052" style="color: green">2</span> as too Jewish) and Paul’s letters (except for the pastoral ones). Interestingly, especially in the light of <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1052004016" data-endverse="1052004016" style="color: green">Colossians 4:16</span>, he substitutes the name “Laodiceans” for Ephesians. This means that Marcion rejected the Jewish scriptures and only accepted certain parts of the New Testament, specifically Luke's Gospel and some of Paul's letters. He also changed the name of the letter to the Ephesians to the Laodiceans, which is mentioned in Colossians 4:16.</p><p dir="ltr">Near the end of this period, Justin Martyr, in describing the worship services of the early church, puts the apostolic writings on a par with those of the Old Testament prophets. He states that the voice which spoke through the apostles of Christ in the New Testament was the same as that which spoke through the prophets—the voice of God—and the same voice that Abraham heard, responding in faith and obedience. Justin was also free in his use of “it is written” with quotations from New Testament Scriptures.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period Three: Second Half of Second Century</h3><p dir="ltr">Irenaeus had the privilege of beginning his Christian training under Polycarp, a disciple of apostles. Then, as a presbyter in Lyons, he had association with Bishop Pothinus, whose own background also included contact with first-generation Christians. Irenaeus quotes from almost all of the New Testament on the basis of its authority and asserts that the apostles were given power from on high. They were, he says, “fully informed concerning all things, and had a perfect knowledge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. having indeed all in equal measure and each one singly the Gospel of God” (<em>Against Heresies</em> 3.3). Irenaeus gives reasons why there should be four Gospels. “The word,” he says, “gave us the Gospel in a fourfold shape, but held together by one Spirit.” In addition to the Gospels, he also makes reference to Acts, all of Paul's letters except Philemon, 1&nbsp;Peter, 1&nbsp;John, and the book of Revelation.</p><p dir="ltr">Tatian, pupil of Justin Martyr, made a harmony of the four Gospels, the <em>Diatessaron,</em> attesting to the equal status they had in the church by AD 170. Other “gospels” had come into existence by then, but he recognized only the four. Also dating from about 170 was the <em>Muratorian Canon.</em> An eighth-century copy of this document was discovered and published in 1740 by librarian L. A. Muratori. The manuscript is mutilated at both ends, but the remaining text makes it evident that Matthew and Mark were included in the now missing part. The fragment begins with Luke and John, cites Acts, 13&nbsp;Pauline letters, 1 and 2&nbsp;John, Jude, and Revelation. There follows a statement, “We accept only the Apocalypse of John and Peter, although some of us do not want it [Apocalypse of Peter is 2&nbsp;Peter?] to be read in the Church.” The list goes on to reject by name various heretical leaders and their writings.</p><p dir="ltr">Translated versions existed by this period. In the form of Syriac and Old Latin translations we secure, by AD 170, adequate witness from the extreme eastern and western branches of the church, as we might well expect from the other evidence in hand. The New Testament collection of books is represented with no additions and the omission of only one book, 2&nbsp;Peter.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Period Four: Third Century</h3><p dir="ltr">The remarkable Christian name of the third century is that of Origen (AD 185– 254). A prolific scholar and interpreter, he conducted critical studies of the NT text (alongside his work on the <em>Hexapla</em>) and wrote commentaries and homilies on most of the books of the NT, emphasizing their divine inspiration.</p><p dir="ltr">Dionysius of Alexandria, student of Origen, indicates that while the Western church accepted the book of Revelation from the beginning, its position in the East was not always consistent. In the case of the Letter to the Hebrews, the situation was reversed. It proved to be less secure in the West than in the East. When it comes to other disputed books (note, incidently, that all in that category have the last position in our current Bibles—Hebrews to Revelation), among the so-called “Catholic Epistles” Dionysius supports James and 2 and 3&nbsp;John but not 2&nbsp;Peter or Jude. In other words, even at the end of the third century there was still uncertainty about certain books, just as there was at the beginning. Period Five: Fourth Century Early in this period, the picture begins to clarify. Eusebius (AD 270–340, bishop of Caesarea before 315), the great church historian, sets forth his estimate of the canon in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (3.3–25). Herein he makes a straightforward statement on the status of the canon in the early part of the fourth century: (1)&nbsp;Universally agreed upon as canonical were the four Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul (including Hebrews, with question about his authorship), 1&nbsp;Peter, 1&nbsp;John, and Revelation. (2)&nbsp;Admitted by a majority, including Eusebius himself, but disputed by some were James, 2&nbsp;Peter (the most strongly contested), 2 and 3&nbsp;John, and Jude. (3)&nbsp;The Acts of Paul, the Didache, and Shepherd of Hermas were classified “spurious,” and still other writings were listed as “heretical and absurd.” It is in the latter half of the fourth century, however, that the New Testament canon finds full and final declaration. In his <em>Festal Letter</em> for Easter, 367, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria included information designed to eliminate once and for all the use of certain apocryphal books. This letter, with its admonition, “Let no one add to these; let nothing be taken away,” gives us the earliest extant document that specifies our 27 books without qualification. At the close of the century, the Council of Carthage (AD 397) decreed that “aside from the canonical Scriptures nothing is to be read in church under the Name of Divine Scriptures.” This, too, lists the 27 books of the New Testament. The sudden advance of Christianity under Emperor Constantine (Edict of Milan, 313) had a great deal to do with the reception of all the New Testament books in the East. When he assigned Eusebius the task of preparing “fifty copies of the Divine Scriptures,” the historian, fully aware of which were the sacred books for which many believers had been willing to lay down their very lives, in effect established the standard that gave recognition to all of the once-doubtful books. In the West, of course, Jerome and Augustine were the leaders who exercised a determinitive influence. Publication of the 27 books in the Vulgate version virtually settled the matter. Principles and Factors That Determine the Canon By its very nature, Holy Scripture, whether Old Testament or New Testament, is a production given of God, not the work of human creation. The key to canonicity is divine inspiration. Therefore, the method of determination is not one of selection from a number of possible candidates (there are no other candidates, in actuality) but one of reception of authentic material and its consequent recognition by an ever-widening circle as the facts of its origin become known. In a sense, the movement of Montanus, which was declared heretical by the church of his day (mid-second century), was an impetus toward the recognition of a closed canon of the written Word of God. He taught that the prophetic gift was permanently granted to the church and that he himself was a prophet. The pressure to deal with Montanism, therefore, intensified the search for a basic authority, and apostolic authorship or approval became recognized as the only sure standard for identifying God’s revelation. Even within the Scripture record, first-century prophets were subordinate and subject to apostolic authority (see, for example, <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047014029" data-endverse="1047014030" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Cor 14:29-30</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1050004011" data-endverse="1050004011" style="color: green">Eph 4:11</span>). When all things were being reexamined in the Protestant Reformation, some of the Reformers sought means of reassuring themselves and their followers about the canon of Scripture. This was in some ways an unfortunate aspect of Reformation thinking, because once God in his providence had determined for his people the fixed content of Scripture, that became a fact of history and was not a repeatable process. Nevertheless, Luther established a theological test for the books of the Bible (and questioned some of them)—“Do they teach Christ?” Equally subjective, it would seem, was Calvin’s insistence that the Spirit of God bears witness to each individual Christian in any age of church history as to what is his Word and what is not. Actually, even for the initial acceptance of the written Word, it is neither safe nor sound (as far as Scripture or history teaches us) to say that recognition and reception was an intuitive matter. It was rather a matter of simple obedience to the known commands of Christ and his apostles. As we saw at the outset, our Lord promised (<span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044014026" data-endverse="1044014026" style="color: green">Jn 14:26</span>; <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1044016013" data-endverse="1044016013" style="color: green">16:13</span>) to communicate all things necessary through his agents. The apostles were conscious of this responsibility and agency as they wrote. Paul’s explanation in <span data-bntype="bibleReference" data-startverse="1047002013" data-endverse="1047002013" style="color: green">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</span> is apropos: “In telling you about these gifts we have even used the very words given to us by the Holy Spirit, not words that we as men might choose. So we use the Holy Spirit’s words to explain the Holy Spirit’s facts” (tlb). Hence, the early church, with closer ties and greater information than is available to us today, examined the testimony of the ancients. They were able to discern which were the authentic and authoritative books by their apostolic origin. Mark’s association with Peter, and Luke’s with Paul, gave them such apostolic approval, and epistles like Hebrews and Jude were also tied in with the apostolic message and ministry. Incontrovertible consistency of doctrine in all the books, including the sometime contested ones, was perhaps a subordinate test. But historically the procedure was essentially one of acceptance and approval of those books that were vouched for by knowledgeable church leaders. Full acceptance by the original recipients followed by a continued acknowledgment and use is an essential factor in the development of the canon. The church’s concept of canon, derived first of all from the reverence given the OT Scriptures, rested in the conviction that the apostles were uniquely authorized to speak in the name of the one who possessed all authority—the Lord Jesus Christ. The development from there is logical and straightforward. Those who heard Jesus in person were immediately subject to his authority. He personally authenticated his words to the believers. These same believers knew that Jesus authorized his apostles to speak in his name, both during and (more significantly) after his earthly ministry. Apostolic speaking on behalf of Christ was recognized in the church, whether in personal utterance or in written form. Both the spoken word of an apostle and the letter of an apostle constituted the word of Christ. The generation that followed that of the apostles themselves received the witness of those who knew that the apostles had the right to speak and write in the name of Christ. Consequently, the second and third generation of Christians looked back to apostolic words (writings) as the very words of Christ. This is what is really meant by canonization—recognition of the divinely authenticated Word. Hence, the believers (the church) did not establish the canon but simply bore witness to its extent by recognizing the authority of the word of Christ.</p>`
